    "There are tons of ways to approach a regression problem. The regularization techniques appended to ordinary least squares optimizes the size of coefficients to best account for error. Gradient Descent also introduces learning rate (how aggressively do we solve the problem), epsilon (at what point do we say the error margin is acceptable), and iterations (when should we stop no matter what?)\n",

    "- show how gradient descent solves and optimizes the solution,\n",
    "- demonstrate the grid_search module!\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring the Gradient Descent regressor object, you'll build a grid search using the stochastic gradient descent estimator for the bike-share data set. Continue with either the model you evaluated last class or the simpler one from today. In particular, be sure to implement the \"param_grid\" in the grid search to get answers for the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With a set of alpha values between 10^-10 and 10^-1, how does the mean squared error change?\n",
    "- Based on the data, we know when to properly use l1 vs l2 regularization. By using a grid search with l1_ratios between 0 and 1 (increasing every 0.05), does that statement hold true? If not, did gradient descent have enough iterations?\n",
